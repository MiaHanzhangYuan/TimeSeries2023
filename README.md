# TimeSeries2023
# Overview

In this study, we aim to analyze students' financial status data over years and personal information to get insights into school's related policy making strategy. This project would imply time-series machine learning models and explore more deep learning network structures.

# Literature Review
This project would be a time series problem which could be modelled by DL network; I am planning to read at least two paper a week, with a reading note written, and run the code, if available. These two papers contain one from Time Series's persective to know basically how to solve the problem and the other one from deep learning structure's perspective to get more idea about improving the model. I would read more if time permits.
